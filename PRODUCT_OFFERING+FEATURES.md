### ✅ **Validation & Market Potential**

- **Problem:** Job hunting is tedious—repetitive form filling, tailoring resumes/cover letters, and tracking applications takes a toll on users.
- **Demand:** Tools like Huntr, Simplify.jobs, and Teal exist because users want automation and organization. But most fall short on deep AI integration or seamless UX.
- **Differentiator Potential:** Jobmate Ai extension stands out by combining smart form auto-fill + AI + smart resume/cover letter generation _in context_, right where users are applying.
