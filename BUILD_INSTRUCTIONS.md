## Troubleshooting

### "vite: command not found"
- Run `npm install` first to install all dependencies
- Make sure you're in the project root directory

### "Permission denied" errors
- On macOS/Linux, you might need to run: `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/vite`

### Extension not loading
- Make sure you built the extension first: `npm run build:extension`
- Check that the `dist/` folder exists and contains all files
- Try refreshing the extension in Chrome after making changes

### Content script errors
- The content script needs to be injected into web pages
- Some pages (like chrome:// URLs) cannot be accessed by extensions
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
